Additionally GitHub doesn't show more than a few lines before and after the change, instead of showing at least a dozen lines before and after (or better yet, the whole file diff, like ADO)."

That is, users submit, then maintainers review at some other time. If the maintainer has to ask for more information/logs/etc. then it wastes the time of both the contributor and the maintainer. Asking for the full template/minimal repro case and all diagnostics upfront is a burden for contributors, but massively reduces the workload of maintainers.","I use both the (new) guided ""form-like"" templates and the legacy ones (such as in your example). the main problems of the legacy one are that users frequently just ignore them or partially complete them. The main drawback of the new one is that it is awkward to set up and maintain. In both cases it can scare away contributors with real problems from raising issues (due to the work required to do so), and therefore the quality of the product may suffer due to not getting legitimate bug reports.",More flexibility in providing progressive forms such as question/answer etc.,not really.
